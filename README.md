# Turing-Machine
This Turing Machine will only give Rotor positions of Enigma on Which Message is Encrypted.

Steps for Running the Software from Terminal.

1. Open the terminal and compile the Program using following command " sudo g++ main.cpp  "
2. Then execute the Program using following Program "    ./a.out Turing.ini Enigma.txt "
3. Turing.ini file only contains the encrypted version of "GOOD MORNING". (which you get from Enigma)
4. Enigma.txt file contains the setting of Plugboard, Rotor 1, Rotor 2, Rotor 3 and Reflector Setting. Turing Machine cant find the rotor position without These settings.
5. If you give correct setting of Enigma i. Plugboard,Rotor1, Rotor2, Rotor3, Reflector Setting to turing, it will  break any enigma which setting match given one.
